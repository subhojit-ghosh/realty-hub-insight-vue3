              one of our apartments! He started off with a 
              very well-thought strategy to market the property. 
              The video that he put together was so professionally
               done and unique, making our unit so appealing. Most 
               importantly, within a short period of time he found 
               us an excellent tenant. Thank you very much!`,

    remarks: `Our experience with Anthony and Qi Homes stands 
      out as the best we�ve ever had with a property services company. 
      Anthony was an absolute pleasure to deal with and really took the time 
      to understand our requirements. We found our ideal apartment with him 
      on the first day and he was extremely professional and responsive 
      throughout the process, making it as stress free and seamless as possible. 
      We wouldn�t hesitate to recommend him to anyone requiring property 
      services and would definitely go back to him if we needed any again in the future.`,

      With the professional service of the agent Tania, it takes only 2 days to confirm the agreement. 
       Tania is very responsive, responsible and appropriate.  It is my pleasure to recommend their personalized service.`,

    remarks: `I found Qi-Homes through social media and had a wonderful experience from start to finish. 
      I was served by one of their agents, Tania. Not only was she responsive, she was very flexible in meeting my
       requests and did everything to the best of her abilities to find the home that I am looking for. 
      I strongly recommend her and the company for your rental needs!`,
